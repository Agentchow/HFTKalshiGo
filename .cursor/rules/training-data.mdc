# Training Data Notes

The soccer and hockey training DBs (`data/soccer_training.db`, `data/hockey_training.db`) record live game snapshots from the GoalServe feed. Known characteristics that are **normal and expected** — do not flag these as issues:

- **Missing `Game Finish` events / NULL `actual_outcome`**: The process is not always running. If it was stopped mid-game, the final snapshot and outcome backfill simply won't exist. This is fine.
- **Score regressions** (score goes up then back down): GoalServe sometimes retracts/corrects goals. A score going backwards between consecutive snapshots is a real feed event, not a bug.
- **Inconsistent `event_type` casing** (e.g. `Game Start` vs `GAME START`): Originates from the upstream feed. Not a data quality problem.
- **Incomplete games / few snapshots**: Same as missing finish — the process wasn't running for the full duration. Not actionable.
- **NULL odds columns**: Backfill is async and best-effort. Some markets may not exist. NULLs are expected.
