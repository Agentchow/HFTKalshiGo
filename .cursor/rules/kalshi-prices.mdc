# Kalshi Price Rules

- The Kalshi WS ticker channel sends `yes_bid_dollars` and `yes_ask_dollars`. It does NOT send `no_bid_dollars` or `no_ask_dollars`.
- For a single market: **YesAsk** is read directly from `yes_ask_dollars`. **NoAsk** = `100 - yes_bid`. These are the only two ask prices we care about.
- `no_bid = 100 - yes_ask` and `no_ask = 100 - yes_bid`. This is Kalshi binary market structure, not a derivation.
- The REST API (GetMarkets) returns all four fields directly: `yes_ask_dollars`, `yes_bid_dollars`, `no_ask_dollars`, `no_bid_dollars`.
