# Kalshi Price Rules

- The Kalshi WS ticker channel only sends `yes_bid_dollars` and `no_bid_dollars`. It does NOT send ask fields.
- Ask prices come from the opposite bid: `yes_ask = 100 - no_bid`, `no_ask = 100 - yes_bid`. This is the Kalshi binary market structure, not a derivation.
- The REST API (GetMarkets) returns all four fields directly: `yes_ask_dollars`, `yes_bid_dollars`, `no_ask_dollars`, `no_bid_dollars`.
